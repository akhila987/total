<h1 id="birthday"><u><i>Birthday parties</i></u></h1>
<p>Choose a date for the birthday party. The sooner you choose a date, the sooner you can get started with planning other elements of the party. Consult with the person whose birthday it is to determine a good day for the party. Check their schedule and take note of any holidays around that time. Keep in mind that many people travel for different holidays. </p>

<h1 id="ann"><u><i>Anniversaries</i></u></h1>
<p>Most countries celebrate national anniversaries, typically called national days. These could be the date of independence of the nation or the adoption of a new constitution or form of government. There is no definite method for determining the date of establishment of an institution, and it is generally decided within the institution by convention. The important dates in a sitting monarch's reign may also be commemorated, an event often referred to as a "jubilee".</p>

<h1 id="hi"><u><i>Seminars</i></u></h1>
<p>In some European universities, a seminar may be a large lecture course, especially when conducted by a renowned thinker (regardless of the size of the audience or the scope of student participation in discussion). Some non-English speaking countries in Europe use the word seminar (e.g. German Seminar, Slovenian seminar, Polish seminarium) to refer to a university class that includes a term paper or project, as opposed to a lecture class (e.g. German Vorlesung, Slovenian predavanje, Polish wyk≈Çad). This does not correspond to the English use of the term. In some academic institutions, typically in scientific fields, the term "preceptorial" is used interchangeably with "seminar".</p>

<h1 id="hello"> <u><i>Religious gatherings</i></u></h1>
<p>
    The central festival of Christianity is Easter, on which Christians celebrate their belief that Jesus Christ rose from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion. Even for Easter, however, there is no agreement among the various Christian traditions regarding the date or manner of the observance, less for Christmas, Pentecost, or various other holidays.</p>
